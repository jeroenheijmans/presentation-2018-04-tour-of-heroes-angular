# Presentation 2018-04: Tour of Heroes Angular

This project is a companion to a presentation from April 2018, and might not make sense without that context.

## More info

This is the result of [the Angular "Tour of Heroes" tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/), with intermediate versions of the code marked with tags.

Check out the *start* of a step with for example `git checkout step-3`.

Run `ng serve --open` to fire up the application.
